âœ… Phase 2 Complete: GitHub Self-Hosted Runner (EC2-Based)

We have provisioned AWS infrastructure to host a GitHub Actions runner using EC2.
This allows you to run CI workflows securely in your own AWS environment.

Provisioned:
- VPC + Subnet
- IAM Role and Instance Profile
- EC2 Runner with Auto Registration to GitHub
- User data script to install dependencies and start runner

Next Steps (Optional):
- Containerize the environment
- Move to EKS and ephemeral runners
- Use GitHub App or OIDC for better auth security

All infrastructure is managed via Terraform.
